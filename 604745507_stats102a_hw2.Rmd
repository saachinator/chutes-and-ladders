I. Flowcharts and Pseudocode of Functions:

  i. show_board()

```
  INPUT: a board object
  OUTPUT: a visual representation of a board
  plot the board on an x, y field with the number of rows and columns as x and y
  add a grid to the board
  a. 
  set the number of iterations to the length of the board/2
  set count equal to 1
  while the number of iterations isn't yet zero
    set x to 0, y to 0
    if value in the list of chutes is less than its follower
      set x to its follower and y to it
    otherwise
      set y to its follower and x to it
    set x1 to the remainder of x/number of columns
    set y1 to the integer value of x/number of columns
    set x2 to the remainder of y/number of columns
    set y2 to the integer value of y/number of columns
    add a red arrow at x1,y1 to x2,y2

  ii. play_c1()

```
  INPUT: board, number of players, and spinner
  OUTPUT: a list: list(winner, turns, chutes, ladders, turns_done, is_close, sixth_turn, total_turns)
  
  if less than 1 player
    return and exit
  make the spinner_vector 1 through the number input, unless a vector was given
  create board_vector from make_list_from_board
  set winner to 0, sixth_turn, everyones_place, turns, chutes, ladders to a vector of 0s, is_close to FALSE, winner_found to FALSE
  while everyones_finished is false
    for each player
      set the new location to the current plus the spinner value, if it isn't over the max
      check if this is the 6th turn, and if so, record it
    if the board_vector at the current place isn't 0 (meaning there's a chute or ladder there)
      set the value_to_match to the current spot
      see if it's divisible by 2, representing a ladder
        if it is, then set the new value of everyones_place[i] to the top of the ladder
        else it isn't, then set the new value of everyones_place[i] to the bottom of the chute
     if everyones_place[i] is the length of the board vector
      everyones_status[i] is true
    if (winner_found is false)
        set winner to i
        set winner_found to true
        check to see if it was close by looping through the players positions + the length of the spinner
      if everyones_status is all true, then set everyones_finished to true
  set turns_done and total_turns to 0
  loop through players and see if the turns are larger than turns_done, and isolate the largest number of turns
  add all the turns to have the value of total_turns
  create a list of everything to return: list(winner, turns, chutes, ladders, turns_done, is_close, sixth_turn, total_turns)

  set the board_vector to number of tiles 0
  a.
  create a chutes_vector, set count to 0
  while count isn't equal to number of chutes*2
    set current to a random value from 2 to the second to last tile
    if the current tile, previous tile, and next tile aren't 0 
      add a 1 to the spot of board_vector[current]
      add current to the chutes_vector
      increment count

    set the place in the board vector equal to a value in the third list of the board to the start_number
    set the second place in the board vector equal to a value after the one previously to the start_number
    increment the start_number and start_chutes by 2

  print(q1a)
```

    a. Minimum number of turns needed to win the game was 7.
    b. 100% of the games were won by the player.
    c. 0.0016% of the games ended in the minimum number possible.
    d. 0 games were close.
    e. The maximum number of turns needed to finish the game is 250.
    f. The most likely square for a player to be on at the end of the 6th turn is 21.
    
  
  ii. 10,000 simulations of two-player games, random seed is UID in reverse
  
```{r}
  q1b <- simulate_game_10000_times(705547406, default_board, 2, 6)
  print(q1b)
